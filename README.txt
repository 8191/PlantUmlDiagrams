This is a plugin for Sublime Text 2.  It currently only works on MacOS and
Linux flavors that have Eye of Gnome.  Patches welcome.

By default, it binds the (Command / Alt)-M key to render any PlantUML diagrams
that are overlapped by any multiselctions.  Each diagram will be rendered and
they will all be displayed using QuickLook or Eye of Gnome.
