# Plant UML Diagrams

This is a forked version from https://github.com/jvantuyl/sublime_diagram_plugin adding a server dependency
https://github.com/evandrocoan/PlantUmlConnection and rewriting the whole git history removing all the java binary files which have been added,
reducing the repository size from `22.49 MB` to `204 KB`.

This version now first attempts to contact the webserver accordingly to the new settings:
```javascript
    // valid values:
    // 'png'              generate images using PNG format
    // 'svg'              generate images using SVG format
    // 'txt'              generate images with ASCII art
    // 'utxt'             generate images with ASCII art using Unicode characters
    // 'latex'            generate images using LaTeX/Tikz format
    // 'latex:nopreamble' generate images using LaTeX/Tikz format without preamble
    //
    // These formats are also supported by plantUml, but they need some
    // prerequisite to be installed... PlantUml return_code = 1 on invocation:
    // 'pdf' generate images using PDF format
    // 'vdx' generate images using VDX format
    // 'eps' generate images using EPS format
    "output_format": "png",

    // It will first try to use the server, because is much more faster than
    // calling directly the jar. If you would like to run a local server,
    // you can install it from: https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-server
    "plantuml_server": "http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/",

    // The full path to the plantuml.jar file
    "jar_file": "C:/Users/plantuml.jar",
```


# Overview

This is a plugin that renders diagrams from your selection in Sublime Text 2
or 3.

By default, it binds the (Command / Alt)-M key and registers a command on the
Command Palette.  Simple select the text for your diagram and trigger the
command.  Multiselections are allowed.  Each diagram will be generated in a
uniquely named file.

If a diagram handler recognizes a diagram in the selection, it will render it
and pop it up in a detected viewer.  Files are rendered into the same directory
as the source file as Portable Network Graphic files.  They will be
automatically overwritten, but not removed.

If you wish to override the viewer used, disable start-time sanity checks, or
change the default character set for diagram files, create a user version of
PlantUmlDiagrams.sublime-settings file in the usual way.

## Install

To install from scratch, it's necessary to have:

* Java (download from java.sun.com)
* Graphviz (I recommend "homebrew" on the Mac)
* Sublime Text 2 or 3

To install, just put a checkout of this project into your Packages directory in
Sublime Text.


## Support

Operating Systems:  MacOS X, Linux, Windows (with default system viewer)
Diagram Types: PlantUML

## Install Instructions

Check out the source directory or download and uncompress the source tarball.
Put this directory in the Packages directory for your platform.

On Linux, it's sometimes "~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/".
On MacOS X, it's "~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/".

Sublime Text should detect the plugin and automatically load it.
